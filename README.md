# Comparison of two online stores in Hong Kong 

1. PARKnSHOP （百佳超級市場）
2. DKSH （大昌)

# Project Description 
I would build my own data crawler, and store the crawled data in the database so that analysts and market researchers can use them to better understand the competition.
The crawler can automatically collect key product info including product name, brand, place of origin, quantity, selling price, discounted price and review.
After the web crawling, you can analyse the price range of specific product, find out when the price is change in database.

# How to install it
